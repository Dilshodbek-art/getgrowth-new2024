I want to redesign the home page of my website (https://getgrowth.online/en). The new home page should be visually engaging, professional, and different from the Services page. Do NOT include testimonials yet. Include the following sections with suggested content and structure:

1️⃣ Hero Section
- Headline: "We Help Businesses Grow Online with Stunning Design & Marketing"
- Subheadline: "Get professional branding, animations, websites, and social media content to attract customers and grow your business."
- CTA buttons: "See Our Services" (links to Services page) and "Contact Us" (scrolls to contact form)
- Visual: subtle logo animation or relevant hero image

2️⃣ Key Services Overview (short summary, teaser only)
- Include 4 services:
  1. Logo & Branding — "Create a memorable brand identity with professional logos and brand visuals."
  2. Motion Graphics & Animation — "Engage your audience with animated logos, explainer videos, and social media animations."
  3. Website Design — "Modern, responsive, and SEO-friendly websites tailored to your business."
  4. Social Media Content — "Eye-catching posts, reels, and ads to boost your online presence."
- Each service should have an icon or small image, 1–2 sentence description, and optional "Learn More" button linking to Services page.

3️⃣ Pricing Teaser (below services, slightly lower)
- Show 2–3 example starting prices, lower than full service page prices:
  - Logo Design — starting at $50
  - Logo Animation — starting at $30
  - Website Development — starting at $150
- Include a note: "Contact us for full pricing and custom packages."

4️⃣ Why Choose Us / Value Proposition
- Highlight in 3–4 visual cards:
  - Fast Delivery — "We deliver high-quality results on time."
  - Affordable Pricing — "Professional services without breaking the bank."
  - All-in-One — "Design, animation, web, and marketing handled in one place."
  - Custom Solutions — "Tailored strategies for your business needs."

5️⃣ Portfolio / Showcase Preview
- Show 2–3 key works (logos, animations, website screenshots)
- Each with hover effect or small description
- CTA: "See Full Portfolio" linking to Services/Portfolio page

6️⃣ Process / How We Work
- 3–4 steps with icons:
  1. Contact
  2. Plan & Design
  3. Build & Deliver
  4. Launch & Support

7️⃣ Bottom CTA / Contact Section
- Headline: "Ready to Grow Your Business?"
- Button: "Get in Touch" linking to contact form

Additional Notes:
- Make home page visually dynamic with bright visuals, icons, and subtle animations.
- Keep text concise and clear, avoid copying the full Services page.
- Structure the page in Next.js format ready to drop into the current project.

Please generate the code for the full home page based on this structure, including all sections, sample content, pricing teaser, and placeholders for images/icons.
