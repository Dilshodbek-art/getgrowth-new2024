You are editing a Next.js project. Make a single, complete update that improves the whole site for a new digital agency (GetGrowth). Follow these rules:

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
- Do not remove my existing styles or break the current design. Reuse existing CSS modules or global CSS. If new styles are required, add them as small CSS module files or a new global CSS but keep the visual style consistent.
- Keep all changes inside the Next.js project structure.
- Use environment variables for secrets: do NOT hardcode BOT_TOKEN or CHAT_ID. Use process.env.BOT_TOKEN and process.env.CHAT_ID.
- If creating files or changing files, list the files you created/modified at the top of your reply and include short comments in the code.
- Make all new pages mobile-responsive and accessible (aria attributes, semantic HTML).

FEATURES TO ADD / FIX (one-shot)
1. NAVBAR
- Update the main navbar (components/Header or pages/_app if needed) to include links: Home, Services, Portfolio, Pricing, About, Blog (optional), Contact.
- Ensure the header shows prominently on mobile and has a hamburger menu if needed.

2. HOMEPAGE (pages/index.js or pages/index.tsx)
- Replace or update homepage content with strong conversion-focused content:
  - Hero: H1 "Helping Small Businesses Grow Online" and H2 "Websites, Telegram Bots, Marketing & Graphic Design — All in One Place"
  - Two CTAs: "Start Your Project" (link to /contact) and "Chat on Telegram" (link uses `https://t.me/<your_bot_username>` — place a placeholder).
  - Short three-column features row (IT & Web, Digital Marketing, Graphic Design) with short benefit-focused copy.
  - Small portfolio preview section showing 3 thumbnails (link to /portfolio).
  - Testimonials placeholder area.
  - Footer CTA linking to contact.

3. SERVICES PAGE (pages/services.js)
- Create a services page describing:
  - IT & Web Solutions (websites, Telegram bots, order bots)
  - Digital Marketing (SEO, SMM, content)
  - Graphic Design (logos, posters, menus)
- For each service add short bullet points, deliverables, and "Starting at" price placeholders.

4. PRICING PAGE (pages/pricing.js)
- Add a simple pricing table with 3 packages per service (Basic, Business, Pro). Use clear short bullets and price placeholders (e.g., €99, €199).

5. PORTFOLIO PAGE (pages/portfolio.js)
- Create a gallery layout (grid) for:
  - Logos (image thumbnails)
  - Logo Animations (embed MP4s or video tags)
  - Posters / Menus
- Use placeholder images/videos with descriptive alt text. Each item should open a simple modal or new page (static dynamic routes not necessary) with a larger view and a short case text.
- Add a short “How we made this” paragraph for each sample item (you will replace these with your actual works).

6. ABOUT PAGE (pages/about.js)
- Add an About Us section with founder intro, agency mission, 2–3 lines about approach, optional small team area (use placeholders).

7. CONTACT PAGE + API (pages/contact.js + pages/api/submit.js)
- Create a contact page with:
  - Simple form fields: name, surname, email, phone (optional), message, hidden CSRF-like token not required for this demo.
  - The form should POST to `/api/submit` using fetch (client-side).
  - After submit, show a friendly success message or error handling.

- Create an API route `pages/api/submit.js` that:
  - Accepts POST JSON with name, surname, email, message.
  - Validates inputs (strip tags, check required fields).
  - Sends the message to Telegram using the Bot API:
      const BOT_TOKEN = process.env.BOT_TOKEN;
      const CHAT_ID = process.env.CHAT_ID;
      await fetch(`https://api.telegram.org/bot${BOT_TOKEN}/sendMessage`, { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ chat_id: CHAT_ID, text }) , headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } });
  - Returns JSON `{ ok: true }` or `{ ok: false, error: '...' }`.
  - Use try/catch and proper status codes (200 for ok, 400/500 for errors).
  - Do NOT log tokens; only log safe messages.

- Optionally (recommended): Save the submission into a lightweight file or Replit DB if available — but only if you detect an existing DB module; otherwise skip. Mention where logs are stored (console only).

8. SEO, META & SITEMAP
- Add head metadata for each page using next/head: title, meta description, canonical link.
- Create a basic `pages/sitemap.xml.js` or `public/sitemap.xml` generator and `robots.txt` in /public that references sitemap.
- Add Open Graph meta tags for homepage and portfolio items.

9. PERFORMANCE & ACCESSIBILITY
- Use Next/Image if images folder exists; otherwise use optimized <img> with width/height attributes.
- Lazy-load portfolio images (loading="lazy").
- Add alt text for all images and aria-labels for buttons.
- Ensure forms have labels for accessibility.

10. STYLING
- Reuse existing CSS. If no clear pattern, add `styles/portfolio.module.css`, `styles/pricing.module.css`, etc. Keep styles minimal and consistent.
- Ensure layout has responsive grid and spacing.

11. TESTING & DOCUMENTATION
- Add a README section or comment at the top of the changes describing:
  - Files added/modified
  - How to set environment variables in Replit: BOT_TOKEN and CHAT_ID
  - How to test: run project, open /contact, submit form, check Telegram
- Do not create any git commits with secrets.

SAFETY / FINAL NOTES
- If BOT_TOKEN or CHAT_ID is missing, the API route should respond with a clear error message describing missing env.
- Keep all code secure and do not output or print secrets to logs.
- Keep changes minimal where possible so the assistant does not replace the entire project structure.

Return:
- A short summary of files created/modified and where to set env variables.
- Sample code for pages/api/submit.js and the contact fetch function in pages/contact.js so I can see exactly how the form calls the API.
